# CloudCAD Frontend

This repository contains the frontend application for CloudCAD, built with Tauri and TypeScript.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

This repository contains two important submodules:

1. **common**: Located at `./common`, sourced from https://github.com/cloudcad/common-shared.git
2. **ui**: Located at `./frontend/ui`, sourced from https://github.com/cloudcad/svelte-ui-v2.git

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Before making changes to either submodule, ensure you create and switch to a new branch within the submodule. This helps maintain proper version control and prevents unintended changes to the main branch.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

### Rust (version 1.80.0 or greater)

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup default stable
rustup update
```

Verify installation: `rustc --version`

### Node.js (version 22.x)

Download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)

### pnpm (version 9.4.0 or later)

```sh
npm install -g pnpm@9.4.0
```

### Tauri CLI

```sh
cargo install tauri-cli --version 2.0.0-rc.11 --force
```

### TypeScript (version 5.5.4 or later)

```sh
pnpm add -g typescript@5.5.4
```

Verify installations:

```sh
node --version
pnpm --version
tsc --version
```

## üöÄ Setup and Running

1. Clone the repository with submodules:

   ```sh
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/cloudcad/cloudcad-frontend.git
   cd cloudcad-frontend
   ```

2. Set up submodules:

   ```sh
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

3. Before making changes to a submodule, create and switch to a new branch:

   ```sh
   cd common  # or cd frontend/ui for the ui submodule
   git checkout -b your-new-feature-branch
   cd ..
   ```

4. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   cd frontend/ui
   pnpm install
   ```

5. Run the development server:

   ```sh
   cd ../native/app
   cargo tauri dev
   ```

This will start the Tauri app in development mode.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with dependencies or versions, ensure all tools are correctly installed and up-to-date. Refer to the `package.json` file for specific dependency requirements.

For submodule-related issues, make sure you've initialized and updated the submodules correctly.
